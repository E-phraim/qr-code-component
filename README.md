## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

I wish to be able to integrate the desktop & mobile designs in the same code and deploy both of them depending on the width of the device

### Useful resources

- [HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites - Book by Jon Duckett](https://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) - This helped me to address minor issues in my code and I will use it going forward.
